# Shadertoy Graphs
This project is a collection of visualizations of miscellaneous shadertoy
data. Current focus is on rendering a directed graph of shader forks but in
the future I plan to add a histogram of shadertoy development over time and
user statistics as well as rendering archived shaders.
