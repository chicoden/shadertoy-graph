        <p>
            This project is a collection of visualizations of miscellaneous shadertoy
            data. Current focus is on rendering a directed graph of shader forks but in
            the future I plan to add a histogram of shadertoy development over time and
            user statistics as well as rendering archived shaders.
        </p>

                    A directed graph of all shadertoy shaders and their forks (as of July 12, 2024).
